## Description
This app allows the user to search through a database of well over 1000 recipes and save them to their profile. They can search different key words and ingredients to find just the recipe they are looking for with detailed instructions on how to prepare the dish. The user is also free to add their own recipes to the database, which will be automatically saved to their profile. From there, this app provides a meal planning page that allows the user to add recipes from their saved recipes to each day of the week, and generate a pdf with each recipe's title and ingredients to make shopping for the week much easier.
